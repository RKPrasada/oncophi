## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

| Risk                              | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                      | Contingency Plan                                  |
|----------------------------------|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Delays in MVP feature delivery   | Medium      | High   | Prioritize critical stories; daily stand-ups for blockers| Re-scope non-essential features for later sprints|
| Resource unavailability           | Low         | Medium | Cross-train team members; hire contractors               | Reallocate tasks across teams; adjust sprint scope|
| Integration issues with 3rd party| Medium      | High   | Early API testing; dedicated integration sprint           | Stub/mock APIs for dependent work                 |
| QA bottlenecks                    | Medium      | High   | Automated tests; parallel QA sprints                      | Increase QA staffing or shift schedule            |
| Production deployment failure    | Low         | Critical| Practice deployments on staging and rollback readiness   | Immediate rollback and hotfix plan                 |

## Dependency Mapping & Critical Path Analysis

- **Critical Dependencies:**  
  1. MVP user authentication must be finished before dashboard and data sync can proceed.  
  2. Reporting module depends on data sync stabilization.  
  3. Advanced feature APIs dependent on core module completion.  
- **Critical Path:**  
  - Week 1: Requirements & env setup → Week 2-3: MVP User Auth → Week 4-5: Core Reporting → Week 6-7: Advanced Features → Week 8: Deployment/Go-live  
- **Tools used:** MS Project & dependency tracker integrated with Jira
