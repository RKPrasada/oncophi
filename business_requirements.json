## Executive Summary

CervixAI is an AI-powered clinical diagnostic platform designed to revolutionize cervical cancer screening, diagnosis, and longitudinal patient monitoring by seamlessly integrating AI algorithms with mandatory human oversight. It leverages a scalable vertical architecture and an episode-based design to ensure continuity of care and prevent fragmented diagnostic workflows. The platform prioritizes explainability via heatmaps and audit trails, addresses data scarcity through synthetic augmentation, and maintains a vendor-neutral posture to integrate smoothly with existing hospital infrastructure. Surgically positioned for US and EU markets with plans for expansion into low-resource regions, CervixAI is architected under a secure, hybrid zero-trust framework and complies with rigorous regulatory standards including HIPAA, GDPR, FDA SaMD guidance, and ISO quality and safety norms. The business aims to achieve clinical excellence, demonstrated by ≥95% sensitivity, significant pathologist workload reduction, and sustained social impact through democratized diagnostic access.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Process screening images and generate triage decisions within clinically acceptable latency (target <60 seconds per case).
- Support concurrent users across distributed clinical sites with minimal service degradation.

### Security

- Enforce end-to-end data encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).
- Implement zero-trust, role-based, and attribute-based access control integrated with hospital identity providers.
- Maintain immutable audit trails and real-time anomaly detection for data breaches.
- Comply fully with HIPAA and GDPR data privacy regulations, including consent management and breach notification.

### Scalability

- Kubernetes-orchestrated microservices enable dynamic resource allocation scaling compute-intensive AI inference workloads and API services.
- Support deployment across hospital on-premises infrastructure and secure cloud environments in hybrid mode.
- Support multi-region deployments to serve US, EU, and future global market sites.

---

## Business Rules and Constraints

- AI diagnostic outputs must always be reviewed and validated by licensed clinicians before final reporting.
- Patient data usage for AI training requires explicit informed consent or must meet anonymization standards.
- Integration with existing clinical systems must not disrupt current workflows or violate vendor-specific interoperability contracts.
- The platform must retain clinical records and AI decision logs for a minimum of 7 years to meet legal and regulatory retention policies.
- User roles must be strictly segregated; administrative users cannot act as clinicians and vice versa.

## Success Metrics and KPIs

- Diagnostic accuracy: Achieve ≥95% sensitivity and ≥90% specificity in clinical validation studies.
- Pathologist workload reduction: ≥40% decrease in screening case volume requiring manual review.
- Regulatory approvals: Obtain FDA 510(k) or De Novo clearance and EU MDR certification before commercial launch.
- User adoption: Onboard 100+ clinical sites and 1000+ active users within first 24 months.
